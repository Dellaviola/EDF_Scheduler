/*
FreeRTOS is a market leading RTOS from Real Time Engineers Ltd. that supports
31 architectures and receives 77500 downloads a year. It is professionally
developed, strictly quality controlled, robust, supported, and free to use in
commercial products without any requirement to expose your proprietary source
code.

This simple FreeRTOS demo does not make use of any IO ports, so will execute on
any Cortex-M3 of Cortex-M4 hardware.  Look for TODO markers in the code for
locations that may require tailoring to, for example, include a manufacturer
specific header file.

This is a starter project, so only a subset of the RTOS features are
demonstrated.  Ample source comments are provided, along with web links to
relevant pages on the http://www.FreeRTOS.org site.

Here is a description of the project's functionality:

The main() Function:
main() creates the tasks and software timers described in this section, before
starting the scheduler.

The Queue Send Task:
The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function.
The task uses the FreeRTOS vTaskDelayUntil() and xQueueSend() API functions to
periodically send the number 100 on a queue.  The period is set to 200ms.  See
the comments in the function for more details.
http://www.freertos.org/vtaskdelayuntil.html
http://www.freertos.org/a00117.html

The Queue Receive Task:
The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function.
The task uses the FreeRTOS xQueueReceive() API function to receive values from
a queue.  The values received are those sent by the queue send task.  The queue
receive task increments the ulCountOfItemsReceivedOnQueue variable each time it
receives the value 100.  Therefore, as values are sent to the queue every 200ms,
the value of ulCountOfItemsReceivedOnQueue will increase by 5 every second.
http://www.freertos.org/a00118.html

An example software timer:
A software timer is created with an auto reloading period of 1000ms.  The
timer's callback function increments the ulCountOfTimerCallbackExecutions
variable each time it is called.  Therefore the value of
ulCountOfTimerCallbackExecutions will count seconds.
http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-software-timer.html

The FreeRTOS RTOS tick hook (or callback) function:
The tick hook function executes in the context of the FreeRTOS tick interrupt.
The function 'gives' a semaphore every 500th time it executes.  The semaphore
is used to synchronise with the event semaphore task, which is described next.

The event semaphore task:
The event semaphore task uses the FreeRTOS xSemaphoreTake() API function to
wait for the semaphore that is given by the RTOS tick hook function.  The task
increments the ulCountOfReceivedSemaphores variable each time the semaphore is
received.  As the semaphore is given every 500ms (assuming a tick frequency of
1KHz), the value of ulCountOfReceivedSemaphores will increase by 2 each second.

The idle hook (or callback) function:
The idle hook function queries the amount of free FreeRTOS heap space available.
See vApplicationIdleHook().

The malloc failed and stack overflow hook (or callback) functions:
These two hook functions are provided as examples, but do not contain any
functionality.
